        <p>We live in a digital age where everything is connected and virtual. The problem with this “always-on” lifestyle is that many people are suffering from burnout. People are seeking tools to help them stay on top of their health and wellness,
          as well as for greater balance between the challenges of health, wellness, work, and life in general.</p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>I've found that looking at what the competition does well or lack of is always good practice. For my analysis I've picked two popular apps at time on the market for wellbeing that approached the same problem in different ways. My
            Possible
            Self had the backing of scientific data to improve people's mental health whereasTangrinefocuses on the idea that by tracking our mood and habit we can make improvements to our overall wellbeing. I've condensed the two's Strengths,
            Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats.</p>

        <div class="">
          <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
          <p>Once the analysis was concluded it was time to ask the people of these concepts in the forms of a user survey, conducted with 10 participants, and research interviews, in which 3 people participated. It was at this point that I realised
            people were not comfortable with or didn't see the benefit of storing and sharing their medical data through the app.</p>

        <div class="">
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>My personas were influenced by the findings of the survey and research interviews I’ve conducted. They’re not exact copies of participants but they do embody real life challenges. I came up with the problem first and tried to create a
            lifelike persona and scenarios around them. Finding the right stock photo for each of them really gave the whole design process an acceleration and had great fun constructing them. In the process of trying to find solutions for my
            personas
            I’ve had a few lightbulb moments on how the app should respond to unique situations. By analysing them one by one certain features of the app unfolded that I wasn’t sure it would include before, like yoga and breathing exercises.</p>

          <img src="img/olive/user persona@2.png" alt="persona">
        </picture>
        <div class="">
          <h3>User Journey</h3>
          <p>While mapping out my persona’s journeys I had to try and walk in their shoes. What would be their feelings or thoughts of setting new goals, how they would feel about setbacks or difficulties along the way, and what tasks they would have
            to accomplish to succeed on their journey. I referred back to the card sorting technique I’ve completed for a previous task to better understand my user’s mental model.</p>

          <img src="img/olive/user journey@2.png" alt="journey">
        </picture>
        <div class="">
          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>It was probably the first time I had to think about the actual logical structure of features of the app. The fact that this phase of the design process has been based on actual data of real users however made this translation of thoughts
            easier.</p>

          <img src="img/olive/user flow@2.png" alt="flow">
        </picture>
        <div class="">
          <h3>Refining the sitemap</h3>
          <p>After analysing the results of the card sort I have merged similar features into one another to condense and simplify the site menu. I also re-labelled some of the menu options to clarify their content.</p>
        </div>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/olive/sitemap@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </picture>
        <div class="">
          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>My approach in creating the low fidelity prototypes was to first make a list of the main features to showcase and then start sketching the basic structure of the app based on my sitemap from previous tasks. When it came to colours I’ve
            settled for dark with hints of neon hue. I’ve found this combination easier on the eyes but still have that momentum.</p>
        </div>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/olive/prototyping@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/olive/prototyping@2.png" alt="prototype">
        </picture>
        <div class="">
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>Everything I’ve created so far quite literally been put to the test in the form of a remote, moderated usability testing. The laborious process of creating a consent form, test script and test plan preceded the testing but they came as a
            huge help during the sessions. I have conducted the tests with 6 participants in total and revisited the process of affinity mapping when it came to sorting and organising the results. The testing revealed both issues that I was expecting
            and ones that were in some ways unexpected.
            This phase of the design process was a great opportunity to summarize and make a complete account of what’s been determined so far and remind myself of the goals.</p>

        <div class="">
          <h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
          <p>There were fundamental issues with my navigation which resulted in completely rethinking the Journal feature. This was the one that confused people the most. In total there were 5 issues that I deemed medium to high-severity and all of
            those resulted in a re-design.</p>

        <div class="">
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Olive is not trying to reinvent wellbeing apps, but it does attempt to combine both mood and habit tracking with personal achievements to help people pay a closer attention to themselves and by adding the management of medical
            appointments
            to the mix it broadens the focus on to physical health too.I’ve tried to take a slightly different approach in terms of visuals when designing Olive. I thought by picking dark colours combined with the neon might make it more genderless
            as
            these kind of apps tend to have a more clean, clinical and bright aesthetic that otherwise might appeal more to women.</p>
